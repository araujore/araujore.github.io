I've been thinking about how we read differently now. Not worse, just different. We skim, we scan, we search for the good bits. Maybe this is fine. Maybe the real insight is knowing when to slow down.

## How We Read Now {#changed}

The internet has rewired how we consume text. We've become remarkably good at extracting signal from noise, at finding the paragraph that matters in a sea of words.<a href="#ref1" class="citation">1</a> This isn't a degradation of reading—it's an adaptation.

But there's a cost. We lose the pleasure of wandering through an argument, of letting an idea slowly reveal itself. We trade depth for breadth, patience for efficiency.

## When to Slow Down {#slow}

The skill isn't in reading fast—it's in knowing when not to. Some texts deserve to be savored. Some ideas need time to settle.<a href="#ref2" class="citation">2</a>

I try to ask myself: is this something I'm reading to extract information, or something I'm reading to think with? The first can be skimmed. The second demands attention.

Perhaps the goal isn't to read more, but to read better. To know which mode of reading each text deserves.
