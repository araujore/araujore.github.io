The question comes up again and again: why bother writing if no one reads it? But that's the wrong question. Writing isn't just communication—it's thinking. The words you put on the page clarify what was murky in your head. That alone is worth it.

## Writing Is Thinking {#thinking}

There's a particular kind of clarity that only comes from trying to explain something in writing.<a href="#ref1" class="citation">1</a> When you're just thinking, it's easy to fool yourself into believing you understand something. But when you try to write it down, the gaps become obvious.

This is why writing is thinking. The act of putting words on a page forces you to organize your thoughts, to find the throughline, to discover what you actually believe. Often I start writing with one idea and end up somewhere completely different.

## The Audience Question {#audience}

Should you write for an audience? Maybe. But the primary audience for your writing should be yourself—the version of yourself that needs to think through this problem, or the future version who will have forgotten these thoughts.

If others benefit from reading it, that's wonderful. But it's not the point. The point is the clarification that comes from the act of writing itself.<a href="#ref2" class="citation">2</a>

Write to think. Everything else is secondary.
